Works with Python 3.8

Dependencies:
pip install datetime, yattag

Usage:
python generate_html.py

Generates an HTML document in the same folder - a moon calendar with info about current moon phase (data comes from moon.py by which I modified slightly)

TODO: pictures for moon phases (tricky illumination %) and zodiac signs (easy)
